 * IGME-102: 9-2 Exercise: Collection Palooza
 * Testing every method/function/property option we
 * have learned for each data type.
 * 
 * Every which way of Arrays, Objects, Maps,
 * Sets, Iterators, DIY Stacks, and DIY Queues.
 * 
 * Overview of work: copy Queue and Stack files from class,
 * then do the rest of this project (declearing + testing) in sketch.
 * I have copied my class notes, but we can use Professor Harris's
 * if preferred/mine break.
 * 
 * TODO: use functions to break up all this testing mess
